## Issues during site development

### Player images and positioning their divs

I used divs for the player images and used the command display: inline in order to display the images horizontally across the screen. Following this I tried to centre the elements but could only do so by adding in margin-left values. This worked for my primary desktop screen but was not responsive when I tested the site on other screen sizes. I decided to use unordered list with the player images in order to centre the elements using text-align: center.

### Statistic pages for individual players was not user friendly

After completing the unordered list for the squad, I added links to their individual statistic page for each player. Clicking on each player and returning to the team page was very time consuming and with a relatively large squad it did not provide a satisfactory user experience. Therefore, I decided to implement a flip card effect revealing the player stats once the mouse hovered over the chosen player. 

### Player images and positioning their divs – take 2

In order to complete the flip card effect, I had to revert to using divs rather than an unordered list. This presented me with my initial problem of centring the flip card divs. I decided to do some further research and found the flexbox method. Using the code display: flex, flex-direction: row, flex-wrap: wrap and justify-content: center, this allowed me to achieve my desired layout. This approach was also responsive on all screen sizes.

### League table became squashed on mobile and other smaller devices

I had an issue with the structure of the league table on smaller devices. As the screen size became smaller the text began to become squashed with some team names requiring 3 lines. I solved this by implementing a scroll function for the smaller screen sizes.

## Validator Testing

•	HTML - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

•	CSS - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator


## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub.Pages. The project was developed using Gitpod where the git version control system was used to commit all changes. The changes were then saved to Github using the push command.
